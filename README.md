# ChatBot
Designing a Chatbot for Facebook messenger with different emotions

The aim is to build software that lets a user connect with a chatbot, and allows the user to specify certain tasks at the same time (i.e. make sure the bot has some memory capacity, so it can ask for reminders, or some advice, based on different personalities).

The most basic model will just be using nothing but RASA Core, so as to demonstrate how to link the chatbot from your personal server to the internet.
